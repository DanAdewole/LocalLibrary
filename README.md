# LocalLibrary (Reader)

Reader allows anonymous users to view a list of available books on the homepage and search for books based on title, author, or summary. If an anonymous user wants to borrow a book, they are redirected to the login page. Logged-in users can borrow books from the available collection. Admin users have additional privileges to manage authors, books, and renewals.
